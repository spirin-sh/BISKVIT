2.1 A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). 
A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.
Hypervisors make it possible to use more of a system’s available resources and provide greater IT mobility since the guest VMs are independent of the host hardware. 
This means they can be easily moved between different servers.
Tyepes of hypervisors:
There are two main hypervisor types, referred to as “Type 1” (or “bare metal”) and “Type 2” . 
A type 1 hypervisor acts like a lightweight operating system and runs directly on the host’s hardware, while a type 2 hypervisor runs as a software layer on an operating system, like other computer programs.
The most commonly deployed type of hypervisor is the type 1 or bare-metal hypervisor, where virtualization software is installed directly on the hardware where the operating system is normally installed. 
Because bare-metal hypervisors are isolated from the attack-prone operating system, they are extremely secure. In addition, they generally perform better and more efficiently than hosted hypervisors. For these reasons, most enterprise companies choose bare-metal hypervisors for data center computing needs.
2.2 Hyper-V Technology Overview
Hyper-V is Microsoft's hardware virtualization product. It lets you create and run a software version of a computer, called a virtual machine. 
Each virtual machine acts like a complete computer, running an operating system and programs. 
When you need computing resources, virtual machines give you more flexibility, help save time and money, and are a more efficient way to use hardware than just running one operating system on physical hardware.

Hyper-V runs each virtual machine in its own isolated space, which means you can run more than one virtual machine on the same hardware at the same time. 
You might want to do this to avoid problems such as a crash affecting the other workloads, or to give different people, groups, or services access to different systems.

Hyper-V offers many features. This is an overview, grouped by what the features provide or help you do.

Computing environment - A Hyper-V virtual machine includes the same basic parts as a physical computer, such as memory, processor, storage, and networking. 
All these parts have features and options that you can configure different ways to meet different needs. 
Storage and networking can each be considered categories of their own, because of the many ways you can configure them.

Disaster recovery and backup - For disaster recovery, Hyper-V Replica creates copies of virtual machines, intended to be stored in another physical location, 
so you can restore the virtual machine from the copy. For backup, Hyper-V offers two types. 
One uses saved states and the other uses Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) so you can make application-consistent backups for programs that support VSS.

Optimization - Each supported guest operating system has a customized set of services and drivers, called integration services, 
that make it easier to use the operating system in a Hyper-V virtual machine.

Portability - Features such as live migration, storage migration, and import/export make it easier to move or distribute a virtual machine.

Remote connectivity - Hyper-V includes Virtual Machine Connection, a remote connection tool for use with both Windows and Linux. 
Unlike Remote Desktop, this tool gives you console access, so you can see what's happening in the guest even when the operating system isn't booted yet.

Security - Secure boot and shielded virtual machines help protect against malware and other unauthorized access to a virtual machine and its data.

Контрольні запитання (Микитенко Назарій)
1. Type 1 Hypervisor is a software layer that is installed directly on top of a physical server and its underlying hardware. 
Its code takes up hundreds of times less space than modern OSes. 
This means that the possibility of a critical error occurring is significantly reduced. 
The security of the system responsible for virtualization is achieved by fully transferring the resources of the physical machine 
under the control of the virtual one. Type 1 hypervisors are mainly used in corporate environments.

Type 2 Hypervisor is installed on top of an installed operating system. In fact, this type is an application of the main OS that is running. 
Linux is often chosen for stable operation. All physical resources and emulation are managed from the host OS. 
A type 2 hypervisor has fewer powers than a type 1 hypervisor. Type 2 hypervisors are usually used in environments with a small number of servers.

2. GNU General Public License is a copyleft license for free software. 
The purpose of the GNU GPL is to give the user the rights to copy, modify, and distribute the program, and the obligation that users of 
any derivative programs also receive these rights. Its basic concept is that anyone is free to use the program for any purpose, 
to study its operation and modify it to suit their needs, and to distribute both the original and modified versions of the program, 
as long as the rights to the original program are preserved.

3. Open source software is a type of software whose source code is freely available for anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute. 
The essence of this software is the ability for both developers and users to adapt the program to their needs, 
which facilitates collaborative development and rapid improvement or creation of a product or application.

4. This is a set of files prepared for installing software. It contains all the necessary components, such as installation files, libraries, 
configuration files, and other resources that ensure the correct operation of the program after installation. 
Distributions can be presented in the form of archives, disk images, or special installers that simplify the process of distributing and installing software.

5. User and group management; process management; file system management; monitoring and diagnostics; task automation; network configuration management; 
system security; backup and recovery; package management; virtualization;

6. Android is based on a modified Linux kernel. Although Android is based on the Linux kernel, it is somewhat separate from the Linux community and infrastructure. 
Android is also not a traditional Linux distribution, as it does not include standard GNU components such as the glibc library, instead using its own Bionic library.

7. Among the features of Embedded Linux, one can highlight its compatibility with many processor architectures, such as ARM, x86, MIPS, 
which allows it to be integrated into various devices and systems. The ability to quickly detect and fix faults and vulnerabilities, 
thanks to open source and a large community. Embedded Linux is used in many areas: in everyday life, medicine, the automotive industry, 
automation of industries themselves, telecommunications and the Internet of Things IoT, as many such devices are based on Embedded Linux, 
which can provide them with the ability to relatively easily connect, process data and integrate with various devices.

8. Text mode (level 3): sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
Graphical mode (level 5): sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
The text interface has less resource consumption, precise control, and ease of automation. The graphical interface, in turn, is more intuitive, but consumes more resources and is more difficult to automate.
